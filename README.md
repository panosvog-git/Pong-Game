# Pong-Game
Pong game created with skratch.
It was based on the tutorial available in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlmBDrnhd2I

It's a game similar to the classic ping-pong computer game. 
There is only one paddle and one ball that moves randomly. 
Every time the ball hits the paddle, its speed increases. 
Every 3 hits there is a change in the background and after 20 hits the game ends displaying a congratulation message.

Made for practicing with Skratch.
